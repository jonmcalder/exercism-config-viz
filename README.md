# Track config visualizer for exercism.io

This is a simple Shiny app for visualizing the `config.json` files of language tracks 
on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/). 

It utilizes `jsonlite` to parse the JSON files and the `visNetwork` package for visualizing 
the progression of exercises as a network path.

It should be accessable via [Shinyapps.io](https://jonmcalder.shinyapps.io/exercism-config-viz/), 
provided that I haven't reached my usage quota.
